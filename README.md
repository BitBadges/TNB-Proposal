# TNB Proposal

#### How would you describe your project?
[BitBadges](https://bitbadges.github.io) is a NFT issuing platform that has first targeted BitClout. They are working on various integrations of badge issuing solutions as NFTs across various blockchains. Currently, BitBadges is looking to integrate TNB compatibility. TNB has various ways badges can be earned, including task based systems and developer integrations. Also, TNB is a high speed cryptocurrency and has potential beyond just a blockchain for devs. With the transaction speeds that TNB offers as well as the BitBadges issuing capabilities, we think this can be a decent multichain or sidechain solution.

#### What problem does it solve?
Currently, we think that from a UX-perspective, BitBadges can be a complementary integration to the TNB ecosystem. We are working on renovating our frontend and want to build interplorability w/ TNB as one of our options.

#### Who is the target market?
We are targeting not just TNB users and everybody using BitBadges, but the entire crypto ecosystem. Badges are utilized for a variety of usecases and even digital certifications or e-learning.

#### What do you think is the opportunity of this project?
There are a series of usecases centered around BitBadges and its many possible different integrations. These include e-learning badges and certification systems, events and ticketing, brand badges, and many others.

#### How does it integrate with thenewboston digital currency work?
BitBadges is interplorable and wants to be able to issue badges on top of TNB as one of its supported platforms.
